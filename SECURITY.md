# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please prefer a private disclosure: open a GitHub Security Advisory under this repository, or contact the maintainers directly via their GitHub account (@srfrog). Do not open a public issue for security-sensitive information.

We will respond as soon as possible and work with you to resolve the issue.
